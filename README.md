Introduction

    I am excited to present the "Bookworm App," a project that I have developed. This readme provides an overview of the project, its features, and my development journey.

Project Overview

    The "Bookworm App" was a solo endeavor, and I was responsible for all aspects of its creation, from design to implementation.

Key Features

    Screens:

    The app is structured around three main screens:

    - Home: Displays the user's lists of books.
    - Book Detail: Provides in-depth information about a selected book.
    - Profile: Offers a user-centric view, showcasing their book lists along with options to view   statistics and edit lists.

Gesture and Sensor Integration

    I incorporated gesture detection and device sensors for seamless navigation, including the use of the Tap Gesture Recognizer.

Target Audience

    The primary audience for this app is readers between the ages of 18 and 35.

Development Approach

    I adopted a hybrid development model and employed various development techniques to create a robust and user-friendly application.

UI Design

    The UI design prioritizes ease of use and navigation, ensuring a pleasant user experience.

Version Changes

    I made several version changes to enhance the app's functionality and user experience:

    - Modified Text-to-Speech functionality.
    - Integrated Face ID detection for added security.
    - Obtained a Google Books API serial key for improved data access.
    - Employed URL mapping for thumbnail images.
    - Thoroughly reviewed development documents.

Problem Solving

    In the process, I encountered challenges and devised solutions, such as creating a separate view for Face ID to improve usability.

Usage

    To utilize the app, follow these steps:

    1. System Requirements:

        - Ensure you have an macOS computer with Xcode installed.
        - It's preferable to have an iOS device, but a simulator can be used as well.
    
    2. Open the Project:

        - Launch Xcode.
        - Open the project file with a .xcodeproj extension.
        
    3. Select Execution Environment:

        - Choose a simulator for testing purposes.
        - Alternatively, for the best experience, connect your own iOS device.
        
    4. Run the App:

        - Click the "Run" button in Xcode.
        - The app will load onto your iOS device if connected, or it will run automatically on the selected simulator.

Thank you for considering my "Bookworm App." I look forward to further development and feedback to make it even better.
